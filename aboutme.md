Hi. I'm Kasey. I do stuff:

- I bake excellent cookies. So excellent my coworkers are glad that waist measurement is gone from the AF PT test. 
- I love my family. And family means our dogs and my husband. He's pretty great, even if he knows nothing about coding. 
- I've been old since I was 6 years of age. I knit, crochet, quilt, etc when I'm not at work or doing homework for this degree. 

Dogs. Family. Cookies. Quilts. 
That's me. 

### My story
I'm also old IRL. So old, at one time we used AOL to IM our IRL friends while we built our MySpace pages. Some of this assignment feels like a flashback to that time. If only there were a link to embed my favorite Flyleaf song from back in the day...
Don't tell me 37 isn't old. You know nothing, Jon Snow.  I've seen enough winters for a lifetime, and am currently relishing life on a subtropical island for the next three years. 
I'm fluent in sarcasm, parle un peut de francais und ein bissen Deustch, and know enough Japanese to constantly apologize and excuse myself because I'm sure I just did something else wrong.
And I need a nap.
